                    <h3>The University of Edinburgh, Developer</h3>
                    <p>I work as a developer in the Student Systems department of the University of Edinburgh. I work mostly within the <strong>SITS:Vision</strong> platform, and also focus on frontend web technologies like JavaScript and CSS.</p>
                    <p>As well as developing new applications within our student records system, I help to support and upgrade old applications.</p>

                        <p>Following on from my work the summer of 2012, I was taken on as a full-time member of staff helping to develop and maintain the University's various online systems, built on an array of infrastructures in a range of different languages.</p>
                        <p>In the summer of 2014 I was transferred to the department's Student Systems team, which focuses on student-centric applications in the University such as the admissions process and course information management.</p>

                        <h4>What have I worked on recently?</h4>
                        <p>From the end of 2015 into 2016, I helped in the <strong>upgrade</strong> of our SITS:Vision implementation. I aided in planning the upgrades, implementing and testing them.</p>
                        <p>During the summer of 2015, I <strong>mentored</strong> a student led project building an Q&amp;A platform for course in the University.</p>
                        <p>During the end of 2014, and going into 2015, I worked on the <strong>course creation and maintenance</strong> (CCAM) process. This has involved updating our course descriptor and a massive aesthetic move to a modern, Bootstrap-based design.</p>
                        <p>Over the summer and autumn of 2014, I focussed on the <strong>undergraduate admissions</strong> process in the University, particularly the management of applications by our admissions team. With a colleague, we overhauled the design and functionality of the portal.</p>
                        <p>For the first half of 2014, I worked on bringing <strong>Path</strong> (a site I helped developed as a student) into the University's corporate infrastructure and making it available to the whole student population for all of the 5,000 courses available each year.</p>

                    <h3>The Dagda Bar, Quiz Master</h3>
                    <p>I run the quiz in the local Dagda Bar every other week, announcing the questions, marking and organising the evening.</p>
                    <p>I'm a huge fan of quizzes, and have enjoyed presenting them for years. As well as being really good fun, I've also learnt a lot about public speaking, working with a crowd and managing live events.</p>

                    <p>With financial and management assistance from the University, a fellow student and I developed Path, a course selection tool for the School of Mathematics. We designed, produced and implemented the application which has been incredibly well-received by members of the university and, now spread to other schools, has been used by thousands of students.</p>

                    <p>I helped prepare, run and clean up behind a wide range of academic and social events for several thousand students in Edinburgh. We were on the go almost non-stop the whole week, often working into the early hours of the next day. It was tremendous fun, and a fantastic learning experience in large-scale event organisation.</p>

                    <p>I spent some time with the BBC as a backstage runner during their first week of having a dedicated Edinburgh Fringe venue. I was responsible for preparing the backstage area and stage between shows, helping to ensure props and performers were in the right place and aiding in various other tasks around the site.</p>

                    <p>I worked as a member of the staff bank over three summers.

        <h2 id="dev">Web development</h2>
        <p>I have been designing and developing websites for several years now, going from a teenage hobbyist to a professional. I tend to work full stack, from arranging databases, to programming, to designing the corners on input boxes. To me, working full stack where possible ensures a consistent and complete website.</p>

        <p><strong>Skills</strong> Several years of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript.
        <br>A few less years of jQuery, Oracle and SITS:Vision.
        <br>More casual exposure to Node.js, Python, Java and Coldfusion.</p>

        <p><strong>Portfolio</strong> A selection of my web design portfolio can be found at <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/portfolio/">https://gregtyler.co.uk/portfolio/</a>
        <br>I also post some of my more granular UI designs to tumblr at <a href="http://thegregtyler.tumblr.com/">http://thegregtyler.tumblr.com/</a></p>
