    <br>Understanding and experience with Agile development, RESTful API design and usage, automated testing, automated deployment, responsive design, accessiblity and progressive enhancement.

    <h4>What I love in web development</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I love leveraging exciting <strong>new features</strong> whilst still making sure my sites are <strong>accessible</strong> to everyone, whether they're using a cutting-edge or an outdated browser, a mouse cursor or a screen-reader, a high-speed internet connection or an old phone.
        <li>I work hard to make sites easy and <strong>intuitive</strong> to use, so that visitors don't have to work hard to see the content they want.
        <li>I love to be <strong>challenged</strong>, to make amazing applications embracing new and inventive ideas; and to turn exciting concepts into real websites.

                    <h4>My history with the University</h4>
                    <p>Following on from my work the summer of 2012, I was taken on as a full-time member of staff helping to develop and maintain the University's various online systems, built on an array of infrastructures in a range of different languages.</p>
                    <p>In the summer of 2014 I was transferred to the department's Student Systems team, which focuses on student-centric applications in the University such as the admissions process and course information management.</p>

                <section class="hidden" id="uoe-projects">
                    <h4>What have I worked on recently?</h4>
                    <p>Since the start of 2016, I have been working on the new <strong>assessment and progression</strong> tools in the University. For the first time, this brings all assessment results from the thousands of courses the University runs into a centralised, semi-automated system.</p>
                    <p>From the end of 2015 into 2016, I helped in the <strong>upgrade</strong> of our SITS:Vision implementation. I aided in planning the upgrades, implementing and testing them.</p>
                    <p>During the summer of 2015, I <strong>mentored</strong> a student led project building an Q&amp;A platform for course in the University.</p>
                    <p>During the end of 2014, and going into 2015, I worked on the <strong>course creation and maintenance</strong> (CCAM) process. This involved updating our course descriptor and a massive aesthetic move to a modern, Bootstrap-based design.</p>
                    <p>Over the summer and autumn of 2014, I focussed on the <strong>undergraduate admissions</strong> process in the University, particularly the management of applications by our admissions team. A colleague and I overhauled the design and functionality of the portal.</p>
                    <p>For the first half of 2014, I worked on bringing <strong>Path</strong> (a site I helped develop as a student) into the University's corporate infrastructure and making it available to the whole student population for all of the 5,000 courses available each year.</p>

                <p>I'm a huge fan of quizzes, and have enjoyed presenting them for years. As well as being good fun, I've also learnt a lot about <strong>public speaking</strong>, working with a crowd and <strong>managing events live</strong>.</p>
