    <h2 id="dev">Web development</h2>
    <p>I have been designing and developing websites for several years now, going from a teenage hobbyist to building applications for tens of thousands of users. I work full stack, from planning databases, to programming, to designing the corners on input boxes.</p>

    <h3>Web development skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Expert front-end skills, including knowledge of JavaScript (including frameworks and build tools), HTML, CSS (including Sass, Less and Bootstrap).
      <li>Excellent knowledge of back-end technologies such as PHP, Oracle, MySQL, Node.js and SITS:Vision.
      <li>Regular usage of Agile development, automated testing, automated deployment and version control
      <li>Experience with RESTful APIs, responsive design, accessibility, user experience and progressive enhancement.
      <li>Professional development with Python (and Django) and Apache Ant.
    </ul>

    <h4>What I love in web development</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I love leveraging exciting <strong>new features</strong> whilst still making sure my sites are <strong>accessible</strong> to everyone, whether they're using a cutting-edge or an outdated browser, a mouse cursor or a screen-reader, a high-speed internet connection or an old phone.
        <li>I work hard to make sites easy and <strong>intuitive</strong> to use, so that visitors don't have to work hard to see the content they want.
        <li>I love to be <strong>challenged</strong>, to make amazing applications embracing new and inventive ideas, and to turn exciting concepts into real websites.

                    <h4>What have I worked on recently?</h4>
                    <p>Since the start of 2016, I have been working on the new <strong>assessment and progression</strong> tools in the University. For the first time, this brings all assessment results from the thousands of courses the University runs into a centralised, semi-automated system. I have been providing analysis on feature implementation and helping bring consistency to the application's front-end.</p>
                    <p>I've supported bringing multiple changes to the <strong>development stack</strong> of the development team, including the addition of a JavaScript style guide, version control, build scripts and automated testing. I've evaluated available tools, determined how to include them in previous processes, written documentation and provided training and support.</p>
                    <p>From the end of 2015 into 2016, I helped in the <strong>upgrade</strong> of the University's SITS:Vision implementation. I aided in organising and responding to regression testing, and planning how we can make use of the new features of the platform.</p>
                    <p>During the summer of 2015, I <strong>mentored</strong> a student-led project building a Q&amp;A platform for university courses. I helped the students with project planning and management, provided code review and put them in touch with helpful contacts in the University.</p>
                    <p>During the end of 2014, and going into 2015, I lead on changes to the <strong>course creation and maintenance</strong> (CCAM) process. This involved updating how staff author their course descriptors and a significant aesthetic move to a modern, Bootstrap-based design.</p>
                    <p>Over the summer and autumn of 2014, I focussed on the <strong>undergraduate admissions</strong> process in the University, particularly the management of applications by the admissions team. I helped to overhaul the design and front-end of the software.</p>
                    <p>For the first half of 2014, I worked on bringing <strong>Path</strong> (a site I helped develop as a student) into the University's corporate infrastructure and making it available to the whole student population for all of the 5,000 courses available each year.</p>
