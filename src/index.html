<table class=employment>
<tr><td>Jul 2013 - Current
<td><strong>The University of Edinburgh, Developer</strong>
<p>Following on from my work the summer before, I was taken on as a full-time member of staff helping to develop and maintain the University's various online systems, built on an array of infrastructures in a range of different languages.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2014 I was transferred to the department's Student Systems team, which focuses on student-centric applications in the University such as the admissions process and course information management.</p>
<p class=js-only><a class=toggler data-toggle=hidden-current-work>What have I worked on recently?</a></p>
<section class=hidden id=hidden-current-work>
    <p>During the end of 2014, and going into 2015, I have been working on the course creation and maintenance (CCAM) process. This has involved updating our course descriptor and a massive aesthetic move to a modern, Bootstrap-based design.</p>
    <p>Over the summer and autumn of 2014, I focussed on the undergraduate admissions process in the University, particularly the management of applications by our admissions team. With a colleague, we overhauled the design and functionality of the portal.</p>
    <p>For the first half of 2014, I worked on bringing Path (a site I helped developed as a student) into the University's corporate infrastructure and making it available to the whole student population for all of the 5,000 courses available each year.</p>
</section>

<tr><td>Jun - Aug 2012
<td><strong>The University of Edinburgh, Web Developer</strong>
<p>With financial and management assistance from the University, a fellow student and I developed Path, a course selection tool for the School of Mathematics. We designed, produced and implemented the application which has been incredibly well-received by members of the university and, now spread to other schools, has been used by thousands of students.</p>

<tr><td>Sep 2011 - Jul 2014
<td><strong>Edinburgh University Student's Association, Quiz Master</strong>
<p>With a colleague, I organised a weekly pub quiz at the students' union. We researched and wrote every quiz and were responsible for running and presenting the events each week. On average we would attract a weekly crowd of around 100 participants.</p>

<tr><td>Sep 2012
<td><strong>Edinburgh University Freshers' Week, Volunteer</strong>
<p>I helped prepare, run and clean up behind a wide range of academic and social events for several thousand students in Edinburgh. We were on the go almost non-stop the whole week, often working into the early hours of the next day. It was tremendous fun, and a fantastic learning experience in large-scale event organisation.</p>
<p class=js-only><a class=toggler data-toggle=hidden-freshers-work>What events were involved?</a></p>
<section class=hidden id=hidden-freshers-work>
    <p>The university put on hundreds of events throughout the week, aiming to appeal to all tastes. Some of the functions I worked in were:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Live music/club nights, where I helped primarily with preparing the venues and queue management.
        <li>Coffee crawls, taking Freshers around various cafés and giving them an opportunity to get to know new people.
        <li>Help and advice points.
        <li>Preparing thousands of event bags.
        <li>Walks around the city, and trips to typical tourist spots.
        <li>Fairs and exhibitions, where I prepared event spaces and provided support to exhibitors and visitors.
    </ul>
</section>

<tr><td>Aug 2011
<td><strong>BBC, Volunteer Runner</strong>
<p>I spent some time with the BBC as a backstage runner during their first week of having a dedicated Edinburgh Fringe venue. I was responsible for preparing the backstage area and stage between shows, helping to ensure props and performers were in the right place and aiding in various other tasks around the site.</p>

<tr><td>Jul 2010 - Jul 2014
<td><strong>Croft Media, Developer</strong>
<p>I formed a partnership with a coursemate to design and develop websites under the banner of Croft Media. I was mainly responsible for the PHP and JavaScript programming though also helped with design, particularly detailed form elements.</p>

<tr><td>Summers 2008 - 2010
<td><strong>NHS Bristol, Clerical staff</strong>
<p>I worked as a member of the staff bank over three summers. As well as spending time in medical records and at the reception desk of the Children's Outpatients department, I was very lucky to spend two months working with the Medicines for Children Research Network, creating and maintaining databases for ongoing vaccine trials.</p>

</table>

<h2 id=dev>Web development</h2>
<p>I have been designing and developing websites for several years now, going from a teenage hobbyist to a professional. I tend to work full stack, from arranging databases, to programming, to designing the corners on input boxes. To me, working full stack where possible ensures a consistent and complete website.</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong> Several years of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript.
<br>A few less years of jQuery, Oracle and SITS:Vision.
<br>More casual exposure to Node.js, Python, Java and Coldfusion.</p>

<p><strong>Portfolio</strong> A selection of my web design portfolio can be found at <a href="https://gregtyler.co.uk/portfolio">https://gregtyler.co.uk/portfolio</a>.</p>
