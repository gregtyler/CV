    <h2 id="dev">Web development</h2>
    <p>I am an experienced and passionate web developer mostly specialising in front-end technologies but with a portfolio of full stack applications. I have led on award-winning projects and worked for clients, charities and corporations, building high impact and high traffic web applications.</p>

    <h3>Web development skills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Expert <strong>front-end skills</strong>: JavaScript (including multiple frameworks and build tools), HTML and CSS (including Sass, Less and Bootstrap).
        <li>Excellent knowledge of <strong>back-end technologies</strong> such as PHP, Oracle, MySQL, Node.js and SITS:Vision.
        <li>Experience of working with users in <strong>agile and waterfall</strong> methodologies.
        <li>Regular usage of automation, version control, APIs, responsive design, accessibility, user experience and progressive enhancement.
    </ul>

                <h3>Assessment and Progression</h3>
                <p>I was lead developer on this wide-reaching project to bring all course assessment and programme progression activity in the University of Edinburgh into a centralised, semi-automated system. This involved coordination with the university's 25 schools who all previously used various combinations of shared and local tools to manage and record student marks.</p>
                <p>Alongside building significant new applications for the management of assessments, entering and processing of marks, this project also involved the management of significant changes to how pre-existing systems handled programme structure, enrolments and publishing student marks.</p>
                <p>The Assessment and Progression system has now rolled out across all of the university and is being embedded in the remaining three schools.</p>

                <h3>London School of Geometry and Number Theory</h3>
                <p>I worked in a team of two to develop the main website for the <a href="http://www.lsgnt-cdt.ac.uk/">London School of Geometry and Number Theory</a>. This included building a bespoke content management system, a full application and admissions process and student administration tools.</p>
                <p>I was responsible for much of the architecture of the website, and lead on the design of the content management system and application form. I also wrote the automated deployment scripts.</p>
                <p>The final iteration and handover of this project is currently being confirmed.</p>

                <h3>Course Creation and Management tools</h3>
                <p>Soon after joining the University of Edinburgh, I was asked to refresh a collection of old applications used to propose, create and manage the 5,000 courses offered every year. These applications were updated to increase academic staff engagement in course management, as well as upgrading the design to be more user-friendly, responsive and match other applications in the university.</p>
                <p>As a result of this project, consistency and accuracy of core university data was improved, academic staff involvement increased, and I presented a paper at the 2017 <abbr title="Student Records Officers' Conference">SROC</abbr> conference about how this was achieved.</p>

                <h3>Path</h3>
                <p>Whilst a student I initiated this project in the School of Mathematics to provide better information to students about the courses that were available to them, how they had been received by previous cohorts, and what opportunities those choices would open for them.</p>
                <p>This project was later taken up by the University of Edinburgh and I helped to embed it across the more than 5,000 courses the university offers. Path now gets millions of page views every year and won the <abbr title="Universities and Colleges Information Systems Association">UCISA</abbr> 2014 <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/news/staff/2015/path-award-060315">Award for Excellence</a>.
