        <li>Excellent knowledge of <strong>back-end technologies</strong> such as PHP, Oracle, MySQL, Node.js and SITS:Vision.
        <li>Experience of working with users in <strong>agile and waterfall</strong> methodologies.

    <h4>My web development passions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I love pleasing a user by providing an experience that fulfils their needs and delights them. Whether they're using a screen-reader, a phone on a 3G network or a cutting-edge browser, it's my goal to give every user an intuitive, accessible and pleasing visit.
        <li>I love learning new technologies and techniques. I'm subscribed to some great blogs and love being inspired by seeing what others are doing. The web landscape is constantly changing and I really enjoy keeping up with the latest exciting developments.
        <li>I love to be challenged, to be given a difficult problem to solve, or a complex feature to implement. Developing to users' specifications constantly brings new ideas and challenges and I relish working on them.

                    <h4>What have I worked on recently?</h4>
                    <p>Since the start of 2016, I have been working on the new <strong>assessment and progression</strong> tools in the University. For the first time, this brings all assessment results from the thousands of courses the University runs into a centralised, semi-automated system. I have been providing analysis on feature implementation and helping bring consistency to the application's front-end.</p>
                    <p>I've supported bringing multiple changes to the <strong>development stack</strong> of the development team, including the addition of a JavaScript style guide, version control, build scripts and automated testing. I've evaluated available tools, determined how to include them in previous processes, written documentation and provided training and support.</p>
                    <p>From the end of 2015 into 2016, I helped in the <strong>upgrade</strong> of the University's SITS:Vision implementation. I aided in organising and responding to regression testing, and planning how we can make use of the new features of the platform.</p>
                    <p>During the summer of 2015, I <strong>mentored</strong> a student-led project building a Q&amp;A platform for university courses. I helped the students with project planning and management, provided code review and put them in touch with helpful contacts in the University.</p>
                    <p>During the end of 2014, and going into 2015, I lead on changes to the <strong>course creation and maintenance</strong> (CCAM) process. This involved updating how staff author their course descriptors and a significant aesthetic move to a modern, Bootstrap-based design.</p>
                    <p>Over the summer and autumn of 2014, I focussed on the <strong>undergraduate admissions</strong> process in the University, particularly the management of applications by the admissions team. I helped to overhaul the design and front-end of the software.</p>
                    <p>For the first half of 2014, I worked on bringing <strong>Path</strong> (a site I helped develop as a student) into the University's corporate infrastructure and making it available to the whole student population for all the 5,000 courses available each year.</p>
