    <p>I am an experienced software engineer and team leader. I have worked on award-winning web projects for clients, charities and corporations.</p>

    <p>My primary focus is on users, solving challenging problems for real people. My work starts with user needs, identifying where to start and providing a strong foundation for how the work is defined, developed and refined. I ensure my work is observable and measurable to ensure that user needs are continuously met as the product continues to develop over time.</p>

    <p>I also focus on my colleagues, providing clear communication and direction, mentoring and support. I've learnt from experince the value of quality in software development, and fully embrace strategies and tools that will continue to ensure that quality for myself and my team into the future.</p>

    <p>I have worked with a lot of technologies in a variety of roles, and bring something from all of those experiences into my work every day. From accessibility to communication, database design to testing, I work hard to make my work the highest quality and ensure it's something I'm proud of.</p>
